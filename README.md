# Wellness at Work
**Insights from our study on Lifestyle, Mental Health Diagnosis, and Effective Treatments**
This explores the intersection of lifestyle factors and mental health. It presents findings and strategies to improve workplace well-being through data-driven insights into sleep, stress, physical activity, and mental health treatments.

- **Objective**: Prevent mental health issues among workers and enhance well-being to reduce absenteeism and improve productivity.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Relationship between **sleep quality** and stress, BMI, age, and gender.
  - Mental health diagnosis trends across demographics.
  - Effectiveness of various mental health treatments.
- **Key Findings**
    - **Lifestyle and Well-being**
      
       *Sleep and Stress*

        - High stress levels negatively impact sleep quality.
        - The relationship between stress and sleep varies across occupations, highlighting the need for tailored well-being strategies.
          
       *Physical Activity and Sleep*

        - A positive correlation exists between physical activity levels and sleep quality.
          
  - **Mental Health Symptoms and Risks**
    - Young workers (aged 20–35) are more likely to experience mental health issues.
    - Men tend to have poorer sleep quality compared to women, though gender is not always a risk factor for specific diagnoses.
  - **Mental Health Treatments**
    - Therapy methods show moderate success rates (37%–44%), emphasizing the need for more personalized treatments.
    - The average treatment duration is 3–4 months, with medication tailored to specific diagnoses.
