# Wellness at Work
**Insights from our study on Lifestyle, Mental Health Diagnosis, and Effective Treatments**
This explores the intersection of lifestyle factors and mental health. It presents findings and strategies to improve workplace well-being through data-driven insights into sleep, stress, physical activity, and mental health treatments.

- **Objective**: Prevent mental health issues among workers and enhance well-being to reduce absenteeism and improve productivity.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Relationship between **sleep quality** and stress, BMI, age, and gender.
  - Mental health diagnosis trends across demographics.
  - Effectiveness of various mental health treatments.
- **Insights**:
  - Stress significantly impacts sleep quality, with differences observed across occupations.
  - Young adults (20-35 years) exhibit the lowest sleep quality and highest prevalence of mental health diagnoses.
  - While gender isn’t a risk factor for diagnoses, it influences sleep quality variations across diseases.


## Functionality ⚙️

- 🧹 **Data Structure**: Process raw data to remove inconsistencies and prepare it for analysis.
- 📈 **Data Visualization**: Create visual representations of the data to identify trends and patterns.

## Tools Used 🛠️

- **SQL**: Main programming language used for data processing and analysis.
- 🐍 **Python**: Main programming language used for data processing and analysis.
- 🐼 **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- 📊 **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.
- 📓 **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive environment for data cleaning and visualization.
- 🌐 **Git**: Version control system for tracking changes and collaboration.

## Development Process 🚀

1. 📥 **Data Collection**: Gather datasets related to sleep, stress, physical activity, and diagnoses.
2. 🧹 **Data Cleaning**: Drop duplicates, nan values and integrate all data frame. 
3. 🔍 **Data Analysis**: Identify correlations, trends, and significant patterns.
4. 📊 **Data Visualization**: Create graphs and charts to present findings effectively.

## Results 📊
Through comprehensive analysis, the project reveals critical insights:

- Sleep quality decreases significantly in high-stress occupations.
- Effective mental health treatments vary across diagnoses, with success rates such as:
- Generalized Anxiety: 43.2% (Mindfulness-Based Therapy)
- Panic Disorder: 43.8% (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy).
